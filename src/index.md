# Welcome

I'm a software developer from Finland. I enjoy building software for any platform, but I have a special interest in web development.

I'm probably still best known as the founder of a well known online video player and video platform, _Flowplayer_. Since
leading the company for 10 years, I've been working on various projects as a freelancer and consultant, and also
as an employee in a few companies. I like to learn new things and I'm always looking for new challenges.

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've been working on:

My latest project is [SpotCanvas](https://www.spotcanvas.com), a trading chart app aiming to provide a compelling alternative to existing platforms. It also serves as my vibe coding playground.

I also developed a betting platform called Parabolic Bet. You can find the code repositories here: [backend](https://github.com/anssip/ultrabet) and [frontend](https://github.com/anssip/ultrabet-ui).

Additionally, I built and continue to maintain [Passlane](https://github.com/anssip/passlane), a password manager. A new version with feature improvements is planned for the future.
