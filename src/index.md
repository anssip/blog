# Welcome

I'm a software developer from Finland. I enjoy building software for any platform, but I have a special interest in web development. 

I'm probably still best known as the founder of a well known online video player and video platform, _Flowplayer_. Since
leading the company for 10 years, I've been working on various projects as a freelancer and consultant, and also
as an employee in a few companies. I like to learn new things and I'm always looking for new challenges.

## Projects

I have a few projects that I'm working on. The most interesting one is a betting platform that I'm building, called 
Parabolic Bet. You can find the code repositories here: [backend](https://github.com/anssip/ultrabet) and [frontend](https://github.com/anssip/ultrabet-ui).

Another one is a password manager called [Passlane](https://github.com/anssip/passlane).
