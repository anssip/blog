After four years of working as a freelance developer and a consultant, I joined a circular economy startup called Emmy.

I have concentrated entirely on hands-on programming and tech work during the past four years. I wanted to have this tech focus to help me level up my development game which had gotten a bit rusty during my 10-year stint as an [entrepreneur in Flowplayer](https://anssipiirainen.com/post/leavingflow/). In my opinion, this worked out pretty well to the extent that pure tech focus is starting to feel a bit _boring_, and it's time for me to take the next step in my path.

## About Emmy

To give some context to this blog post, let me first briefly introduce Emmy. The following quote is from [Emmy's LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emmy-clothing-company/)

> Emmy is a pioneering service for consumers to recirculate brand apparel that they no longer need. Reinventing the way people sell and buy second-hand items, we offer an effortless turnkey service for people to wake up the money sleeping in their wardrobes.

The **circular fashion economy** is growing faster than the traditional linear fashion market. [According to this article](https://www.therobinreport.com/the-circular-fashion-future/), the resale segment grows 24x faster than retail. With 20 %+ monthly sales growth, Emmy is one of the fastest-growing apparel recirculation operators in the Nordics and Europe.

## Motives and Purpose of Work

There are a couple of motives that pushed me to this move. First, I want to expand my role beyond purely technical hands-on work. In Emmy, we plan to grow the development efforts and expand our development team with both in-house and external developers. Being one of the company's first in-house tech people means that I get to drive the successful growth of these efforts.

Building software is more than just programming: As an engineer, I think of it as **Software Engineering**, which takes a holistic look at building software. It takes more than just typing on the keyboard to build quality software effectively: People and the team, communication, processes, company culture, learning and knowledge building and similar "soft issues" all play important roles here.

Suppose I would continue my career concentrating mainly on programming as a consultant. In that case, I think I would be wasting 70% of the skills and experience that I have gained during my 30 years career in software engineering. I'm looking to Emmy now as an opportunity to widen my professional scope so that I can use my current skills fully and also learn more.

Now more than ever, the **purpose** of work has become vital to me. I hope to experience the excitement of working in a startup environment again. I look forward to being an **integral part of making Emmy a success**. Being part of something great provides purpose for me. As a consultant, I have missed that.

Emmy's role in the circular economy is the second part of the meaningful purpose. Following surely sounds like a clichÃ©, but Emmy is making the world a better place by providing means for people to recycle.

> We need to recycle to save the planet. I want to advance the transition to a circular economy where recycling is the norm. This mission feels more purposeful than the ones I have been working on lately: ad-tech and consulting to bill an hourly rate.

## The tech stack

Saving the world is nice, but it's even better with cool tech. I will be working on state-of-the-art technology in Emmy, including tools like Shopify and GraphQL APIs, serverless & Lambda, Next.js, Contentful.

I'm excited to dive into these technologies during the upcoming weeks and months. Especially the serverless stuff I look forward to learning and mastering.

Stay tuned for another blog post, perhaps more about the tech aspects of building an e-commerce store. Watch this space for the next update :-)
